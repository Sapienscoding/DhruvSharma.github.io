Hi, I'm Dhruv, a roboticist who recently graduated from the **University of Maryland, College Park**. I've completed my bachelor's in **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** from **Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIPU)**, Delhi. Recently, I have been honored with an **AIFS fellowship**, through which I will be interning with [Farm_ng](https://farm-ng.com/) as a **Robotics Software Engineer**.Previously, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant under [Dr. Yantian Zha](https://robotics.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1740/Yantian-Zha) on a imitation learning based multimodal robot for task planning. As a RA, my part was to compute the task plans generated from LTL formulae using **PDDL** and to develop **ROS service nodes** to execute it. Throughout my master's, I have acquired knowledge and experience in various aspects of robotics, ranging from basic modeling to utilizing sophisticated algorithms/networks for addressing planning and perception challenges. My particular interest lies in the perception and motion planning aspects of robotics that involve integrating embedded devices.

I'm actively looking for full-time roles in this industry, please feel free to reach out at: [dhruv337@gmail.com](dhruv337@gmail.com)
